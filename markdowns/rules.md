# Rules...

> And yes, if caught, you will be disqualified, sorry 😏

## Rules:
* Firstly, no violence.
* No theft. If caught at any point, you'll be disqualified. (This includes theft of points.)
* Temporary absence of more than 5 minutes is grounds for disqualification.
* Arguing with gods or angels results in direct disqualification.
* It's just a verbal duel, friends... So have fun. No need for personal agendas. Work and play within the rules.
